# **End-to-End House Price Estimator Using Ikman.lk Data (2021)**

## **Project Overview**
The Sri Lankan real estate market lacks a reliable system for accurately estimating house prices, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to determine fair property values. Prices vary significantly based on multiple factors such as:
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Number of Bathrooms**
- **Location**
- **Land Size (Perches)**
- **House Size (Square Feet)**

This project aims to develop an **End-to-End House Price Estimator** using **2021 data from Ikman.lk**. By leveraging **machine learning**, the model analyzes historical property listings to predict house prices based on key features. 

## **Objectives**
- Provide accurate house price predictions based on real estate data.
- Help buyers make informed decisions when purchasing a property.
- Assist sellers in setting competitive and realistic prices.
- Enhance transparency and efficiency in real estate transactions.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python 
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Flask (for deployment)
- **Modeling:** Machine Learning (Regression Models)
- **Data Source:** Ikman.lk (2021 dataset)
